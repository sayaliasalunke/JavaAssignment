What are classes and objects in Java? 
ANS :
    Class :
	- A class is a blueprint used to create objects 
	- it share common properties and behavior.
	- Can contain fields, methods, constructors, nested classes and interfaces.
	- Class is a collection of Data members and member Function
	
	Object :
	- An object is an instance of a class created to access its data and operations. 
	- Each object holds its own state.
	- An object is a real instance of a class.
    - It represents a real-world entity and uses the properties and methods of the class.
    
    
2.What is the difference between primitive and reference data types?
ANS :
	- Primitive stores the actual value, while Reference stores the address of the value.
	- Primitive has a fixed size, while Reference size can vary.
	- Primitive is faster to access, while Reference is slightly slower.
	- Primitive does not have methods, while Reference can have methods.
	- Primitive cannot be null, while Reference can be null.
	
3.What are access modifiers in Java?
ANS : 
	Access modifiers are keywords in Java that control who can access classes, variables, methods, 
	and constructors.
	Access modifires in java : 
	- public
	- Private
	- Protected
	
	- public :
		Accessible from anywhere
		public int x;
	
	- private
	
		Accessible only within the same class
		private int y;
		
	- protected
	
		Accessible within the same package and outside the package through inheritance
		protected int z;

4.Explain the concept of encapsulation. 
ANS :
	- Encapsulation means hiding data and protecting it from direct access.
	- It binds variables and methods together in one class.
	- Data members are made private to keep them safe.
	- Access to data is given using public getter and setter methods.
	- It helps in security, data control, and code maintenance.
	
5.What is inheritance and why is it used?
ANS :
	- Inheritance means one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.
	- The class that gives data is called parent (super) class.
	- The class that receives data is called child (sub) class.
	- It is used to reuse code and reduce duplication.
	- It helps in maintaining and extending code easily.
