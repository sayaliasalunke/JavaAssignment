Assignment 1

1.What is Java and why is it platform-independent? 
	Java is a object oriented programming language used to develop different types of applications.
	 Java is platform-independent because it does not run directly on the operating system. 
	 When Java code is compiled, it is converted into bytecode. 
	 This bytecode can run on any system that has a JVM. 
	 Since JVM is available for different operating systems,
	 the same Java program can run on multiple platforms without any changes.

2.Explain the features of Java. 
 	 Java is simple and object-oriented, making programs easy to develop and maintain.
	 It is platform-independent because it uses bytecode and JVM.
	 Java is secure and robust due to memory management and exception handling.
	 It supports multithreading and dynamic behavior, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

3.What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM? 
	JVM (Java Virtual Machine) :
	JVM is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode.
	It converts bytecode into machine code.
	It make Java platform- independent.
	Jvm does not develop programs, it only runs them.
	eg. It executes .class files.
	
	JRE (Java Runtime Environment) :

	JRE provides the environment to run Java programs.
	It contains JVM + core Java libraries.
	Used by end users to run Java applications.
	Cannot be used to write or compile Java code.
	eg.Needed to run a Java application.

	JDK (Java Development Kit) :
	
	JDK is a complete package for Java development.
	It contains JRE + development tools.
	Tools include: javac, java, debugger, compiler, etc.
	Used by developers to write, compile, and run Java programs.
	eg. Required to develop Java applications.
	
4.What is bytecode in Java? 
	Bytecode in Java is an intermediate code generated when a Java program is compiled.
	When you write Java code, it is saved as a .java file.
	After compilation, it becomes a .class file.
	This .class file contains bytecode.
	Bytecode is not machine-specific.
	It can run on any operating system that has a JVM.
	JVM reads the bytecode and converts it into machine code.
	
5.Explain the concept of object-oriented programming. 
	
	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs by treating everything as objects. 
	Each object has data and methods that work on that data.
	OOP helps make code easy to understand, reuse, and manage 
	by using concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
	
	1.Encapsulation (Data Hiding)
	Wrapping data and methods together and protecting data from outside access.
	2.Inheritance (Reusability)
	One class inherits properties and methods of another class.
	3.Polymorphism (Many Forms)
	Same method name, different behavior.
	4.Abstraction (Hiding Implementation)
	Showing what an object does, not how it does.
