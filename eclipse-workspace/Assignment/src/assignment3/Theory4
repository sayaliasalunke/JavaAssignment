1.What is Polymorphism?
ANS :

	Polymorphism means one thing having many forms.
	In Java, the same method name can perform different actions.
	
	Example:
	A method add() can add integers and also add decimal numbers.
	It helps in increasing flexibility and reusability of code.
	
2.What is Method Overloading?
ANS :
	Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.
	
	Example:
	add(int a, int b)
	add(double a, double b)
	
3.What is Method Overriding?

	- Method overriding means when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in 
	the parent class.
	- Method name and parameters must be same.
	- It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
	
4.Difference Between Compile-time and Runtime Polymorphism
	1.Compile-time Polymorphism
	
		- Achieved by method overloading.
		- Method call is decided at compile time.
		- Same method name but different parameters.
		- Also called Static Polymorphism.
		- Execution is faster.
	
	2.Runtime Polymorphism
	
		- Achieved by method overriding.
		- Method call is decided at runtime.
		- Same method name and same parameters.
		- Also called Dynamic Polymorphism.
		- Execution is slightly slower than compile-time.
		
5.Single, Multilevel and Hierarchical Inheritance in simple words

	- Single Inheritance
	
		When one child class takes properties and methods from one parent class, it is called single inheritance.
		One parent → One child
		
		Example:
		class B extends A
	
	 - Multilevel Inheritance
	
		When a class inherits from a parent class, and another class inherits from that child class, it is called multilevel inheritance.
		A → B → C
		The last class can use properties of all previous classes.
	
	- Hierarchical Inheritance
	
		When many child classes inherit from one parent class, it is called hierarchical inheritance.
		One parent → Many children
		
		Example:
		class B extends A
		class C extends A
