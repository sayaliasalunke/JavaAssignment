What is the main method’s signature and why is it static?

	public → so the JVM can access it from anywhere and start the program.
	static → so the JVM can run it without creating an object of the class.
	void → because it doesn’t return anything to the JVM.
	main → this is the fixed entry point name that the JVM looks for.
	String[] args → used to take command-line arguments as input.
	
	 main is static because:
	 The JVM starts execution directly from the class, not from an object. 
	 If main were not static, the JVM would first need to create an object of the class, which could cause confusion about which constructor to call. 
	 Making it static allows the program to start cleanly and directly.
 
 What are wrapper classes in Java?
 	Wrapper classes are predefined classes in Java that convert primitive data types into objects.
	Java provides wrapper classes because many features (like collections) work only with objects.
	
	int → Integer
	double → Double
	char → Character
	boolean → Boolean
	It is  use primitives in collections like ArrayList,convert data types,provide utility methods
	
	Difference between equals() and == operator
	The == operator compares memory addresses and checks whether two references point to the same object.
	The equals() method compares the actual content or value of objects.
	== works with both primitives and objects, while equals() is used only with objects.
	equals() can be overridden to define custom comparison logic, but == cannot.
	
	What is the final keyword used for?
	The final keyword in Java is used to restrict changes.
	A final variable cannot have its value changed once assigned.
	A final method cannot be overridden by a subclass.
	A final class cannot be inherited.
	
	Difference between final, finally, and finalize.
	final is a keyword used to apply restrictions in Java. 
	A final variable cannot be changed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final class cannot be inherited.

	finally is a block used with try–catch that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurs. 
	It is mainly used for cleanup code like closing files or database connections.
	
	finalize() is a method that is called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed, used to perform cleanup activities. 
	It is not guaranteed when or if it will be called.
