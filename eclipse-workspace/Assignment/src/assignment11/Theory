1️ What is the Collection Framework?

	The Collection Framework in Java is a set of classes and interfaces used to store and manipulate groups of objects.
	It provides ready-made data structures like lists, sets, and maps.
	It helps in performing operations such as searching, sorting, and inserting easily.
	It reduces the need to write your own data structure code.
	It is part of the java.util package.
	Overall, it makes data handling efficient and standardized.

2️ What are the interfaces of the Collection Framework?

	The main interfaces of the Collection Framework are Collection, List, Set, Queue, and Map.
	Collection is the root interface for most collection types.
	List allows duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.
	Set does not allow duplicate elements.
	Queue is used for holding elements before processing.
	Map stores data in key-value pairs and does not extend Collection.

3️ What is the difference between Collection and Collections?

	Collection is an interface in Java used to represent a group of objects.
	It is the root interface of the Collection Framework.
	Collections is a utility class in the java.util package.
	It contains static methods like sort(), reverse(), and shuffle().
	So, Collection is used to store data, while Collections is used to perform operations on that data.

4️ Difference between List, Set, and Map

	List allows duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.
	Set does not allow duplicate elements and may or may not maintain order.
	Map stores elements in key-value pairs instead of single objects.
	In Map, keys must be unique but values can be duplicated.
	List and Set extend the Collection interface, but Map does not.
	These are used based on whether we need ordering, uniqueness, or key-value mapping.

5️ What is ArrayList?

	ArrayList is a class that implements the List interface.
	It stores elements in a dynamic array.
	It allows duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.
	It provides fast random access using index numbers.
	It automatically resizes when elements are added or removed.
	ArrayList is best when frequent retrieval operations are required.
