1) What is LinkedList?

	LinkedList is a class in Java that implements the List interface and is part of the Java Collection Framework.
	It stores elements in the form of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next (and previous) node.
	It allows duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.
	Insertion and deletion are faster compared to ArrayList because no shifting is required.

2) Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList

	ArrayList vs LinkedList:
	ArrayList uses a dynamic array, while LinkedList uses a doubly linked list.
	ArrayList is faster for accessing elements (random access).
	LinkedList is faster for insertion and deletion operations.
	ArrayList consumes less memory compared to LinkedList.
	LinkedList is better when frequent insertions/deletions are required.

3) What is HashSet?

	HashSet is a class in Java that implements the Set interface and is part of the Java Collection Framework.
	It stores unique elements and does not allow duplicates.
	It does not maintain insertion order.
	It uses hashing internally for storing elements, so operations like add, remove, and search are fast.

4) What is LinkedHashSet?

	LinkedHashSet is a class that extends HashSet and implements the Set interface.
	It stores unique elements and does not allow duplicates.
	It maintains insertion order.
	It uses a combination of hash table and linked list to store elements.

5) What is TreeSet?

	TreeSet is a class in Java that implements the Set interface and stores elements in sorted order.
	It does not allow duplicate elements.
	It uses a self-balancing tree (Red-Black Tree) internally.
	Elements are sorted in natural order or by a Comparator.
	It is slower than HashSet because it maintains sorting.
