Difference between HashSet and TreeSet 

	HashSet uses a hash table internally, while TreeSet uses a Red-Black Tree.
	HashSet does not maintain order, TreeSet stores elements in sorted order.
	HashSet allows one null value, TreeSet does not allow null (in most cases).
	HashSet operations are generally faster (O(1)), TreeSet operations take O(log n).
	TreeSet is used when sorted data is required.
	HashSet is preferred when ordering is not important.

2️ What is Map Interface? 

	Map is an interface in the Java Collection Framework that stores data in key-value pairs.
	Each key is unique, but values can be duplicated.
	It is part of the java.util package.
	Common implementations are HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.
	Map does not extend Collection interface.

3️ Difference between HashMap and Hashtable 

	HashMap is not synchronized, but Hashtable is synchronized (thread-safe).
	HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values, Hashtable allows no null key or value.
	HashMap is faster because it is not synchronized.
	Hashtable is a legacy class, while HashMap is modern (introduced in Java 1.2).
	HashMap uses fail-fast iterator; Hashtable uses Enumerator (not fail-fast).

4️ What is LinkedHashMap? 

	LinkedHashMap is a subclass of HashMap.
	It maintains insertion order of elements.
	It uses a combination of Hash table and Doubly Linked List.
	It allows one null key and multiple null values.
	It is slightly slower than HashMap due to ordering maintenance.

5️ What is TreeMap? 

	TreeMap is a Map implementation that stores keys in sorted order.
	It uses a Red-Black Tree internally.
	It does not allow null keys, but allows multiple null values.
	Operations like put, get, remove take O(log n) time.
	It is used when sorted key-value mapping is required.
