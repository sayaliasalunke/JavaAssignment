What is abstraction in Java? 
	Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding internal implementation details and showing only the required functionality to the user.
	It helps the programmer focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. 
	In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
	

What is an abstract class? 
		An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be used to create objects and is meant to be extended by other classes. 
		It may contain methods without implementation as well as implemented methods, so it provides a common base while leaving some work to the child classes. 
		Abstract classes are mainly used when we want to define a structure but allow subclasses to give their own behavior.
		
What is an interface in Java?
		An interface in Java is a contract that tells a class what methods it must implement, but it does not explain how those methods work.
		 When a class implements an interface, it agrees to provide its own logic for all the methods defined in the interface.
		 Interfaces are mainly used to achieve abstraction and to allow multiple inheritance in Java.
		 

Difference between abstract class and interface
	Abstract class vs Interface

	An abstract class is like a partially finished class. 
	It can have both methods with code and methods without code. It is used when classes are closely related and can share some common behavior.
	
	An interface is like a rule book or contract. It only tells what methods a class must implement, not how. 
	It is used when different classes need to follow the same rules, even if they are not related.
	
	
What is a constructor?
		A constructor is a special method in Java that is automatically called when an object is created. 
		Its main job is to initialize the object, meaning it sets initial values for variables and prepares the object for use.
		 A constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.
