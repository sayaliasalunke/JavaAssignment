1) How are Strings stored in memory?

	 In Java, Strings are stored in heap memory. 
	 String literals are stored in a special area called the String Constant Pool.
	 If a string literal already exists in the pool, Java reuses the same object. 
	 Strings created using the new keyword are stored in the heap outside the pool. 
	 This approach saves memory.
	  Strings are immutable, so sharing them is safe.

2) What is an array in Java?

	 An array in Java is a data structure used to store multiple values of the same data type.
	 The elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. 
	 Each element is accessed using an index value.
	 The index starts from zero. Arrays help in efficient data storage and retrieval.

3) How do you declare and initialize an array?

	An array is declared by specifying the data type followed by square brackets. 
	It can be initialized at the time of declaration or later. 
	For example, int[] arr = {10, 20, 30};. 
	Memory is allocated when the array is initialized. Each element is accessed using its index.

4) What are jagged arrays?

	 A jagged array is an array of arrays where each sub-array can have different lengths.
	 It is different from a regular multidimensional array.
	 Memory is allocated separately for each row.
	 This helps in saving memory. Jagged arrays are used when data size varies.

5) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

	 ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime exception in Java.
	 It occurs when we try to access an array element using an invalid index.
	 This happens if the index is negative or greater than the array size.
	 It indicates a logical error in the program. This exception occurs at runtime.
