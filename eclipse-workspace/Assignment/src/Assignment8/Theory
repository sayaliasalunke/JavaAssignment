1.What are local and anonymous classes?
ANS : 
	Local Class : 
	- Local class has a name.
	- A local class is a class defined inside a method, constructor, or block.
	- It is used when the class is needed only inside that method.
	- It can access local variables of the method (only final or effectively final).
	Example:
	
		void display() {
		    class LocalClass {
		        void msg() {
		            System.out.println("Inside local class");
		        }
		    }
		    LocalClass obj = new LocalClass();
		    obj.msg();
		}
	
	Anonymous Class :
	- Anonymous class does not have a name.
	- An anonymous class is a class without a name.
	- It is used for one-time use, usually to override methods.
	- Commonly used with interfaces or abstract classes.
	Example:
	
		Runnable r = new Runnable() {
		    public void run() {
		        System.out.println("Anonymous class");
		    }
		};

2 What is a String in Java?
ANS : 
	- A String is an object that represents a sequence of characters.
	- In Java, String objects are immutable.
	- String class belongs to java.lang package.
	Example:
	
		String name = "Kranti";
		
3 Difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer. 
ANS :
	1.String
	- String is immutable in Java.
	- Once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed.
	- Any modification creates a new object in memory.
	- It is thread-safe due to immutability.
	- Used when data does not change frequently.

	2.StringBuilder
	- StringBuilder is mutable.
	- It allows modification of the same object.
	- It is not thread-safe.
	- Faster than String and StringBuffer.
	- Used in single-threaded applications.

	3.StringBuffer
	- StringBuffer is mutable.
	- It allows modification of the same object.
	- It is thread-safe because its methods are synchronized.
	- Slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization.

Used in multi-threaded applications.
4 Why are Strings immutable? 
ANS :
	Strings are immutable for:
	- Security
	- Thread safety
	- Memory efficiency (String Pool)
	- Better performance (hashcode caching)
	- Because of immutability, String objects are safe to use in collections like HashMap.

5 What is a String Pool in Java?
ANS :
	- SCP (String Constant Pool) is a special memory area inside the Heap memory where Java stores String literals.
	- To save memory and avoid duplicate String objects.
	- If two strings have the same value, Java stores only one copy in SCP.
	- if the same String literal is created again, Java does not create a new object.
	- It reuses the existing object from the pool to save memory.
