Difference between deep copy and shallow copy

	A shallow copy creates a new object, but it copies the references of nested or child objects instead of creating new copies.
	This means both the original and copied objects share the same memory reference for internal objects.
	So, if we modify the referenced object, changes will reflect in both objects.
	
	A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a new object and also recursively copies all nested objects.
	Each object has its own separate memory location.
	So, any modification in the copied object does not affect the original object.
	
	shallow copy shares references, whereas deep copy creates completely independent objects.
	

What are varargs in Java?

	Varargs (variable arguments) allow a method to accept a variable number of arguments of the same type.
	It is declared using three dots (...) after the data type.
	Internally, varargs are treated as an array.
	It improves flexibility and reduces the need for multiple overloaded methods

What is Autoboxing and Unboxing?

	It was introduced in Java 5 to simplify working with collections.	
	
	Autoboxing converts primitive types into wrapper objects automatically, and unboxing converts wrapper objects back to primitives.
	Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of a primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class object.
	Example: int → Integer.

	Unboxing is the automatic conversion of a wrapper class object into its corresponding primitive type.
	Example: Integer → int.
	
Difference between == and equals() for Strings.

	== compares memory references (addresses) of objects.
	equals() compares the actual content or values of objects.
	
	For Strings:
	== checks if both references point to the same object.
	equals() checks if the characters inside the strings are the same.
	
Explain String Concatenation and Interning
	String Concatenation means joining two or more strings using the + operator or concat() method.
	When we use +, Java internally uses StringBuilder for efficiency.
	
	String Interning means storing only one copy of each distinct string value in the String Constant Pool.
	If two strings have the same value, they refer to the same memory location in the pool.
	We can force interning using the intern() method.
