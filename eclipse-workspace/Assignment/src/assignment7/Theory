1.What is Garbage Collection?
ANS :
	Garbage Collection is a process in Java that automatically removes unused objects from memory.
	It helps in freeing heap memory and prevents memory leaks.
	Java handles memory management automatically using the garbage collector.
	We can request it using System.gc(), but execution is controlled by JVM.

2️ What are Packages in Java?
ANS :
	A package is a group of related classes and interfaces.
	It helps in organizing code properly and avoiding name conflicts.
	Packages also provide access protection and better code management.
	Example: java.util, java.lang.
	
	package mypack;   // creating package

	public class Demo {
	    public void show() {
	        System.out.println("Hello");
	    }
	}
		

3️ What is the Default Package?
ANS :
	If we do not specify any package name in a Java program, it belongs to the default package.
	It has no package statement at the top of the file.
	It is generally used for small or beginner programs.
	
	public class Test {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
	        System.out.println("Default package example");
	    }
	}
		

4️ Explain the use of import statements.
ANS :
	The import statement is used to access classes from other packages.
	It allows us to use classes without writing their full package name.
	Example: import java.util.Scanner;
	
	import java.util.Scanner;

	public class InputExample {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
	        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	        int num = sc.nextInt();
	    }
	}
		

5️ What are Nested Classes in Java?
ANS :
	A nested class is a class defined inside another class.
	It helps in logically grouping related classes together.
	There are two types:
	
	1.Static Nested Class
	2.Inner Class (non-static)
	They improve code readability and security.
	
	
		class Outer {
	    class Inner {
	        void display() {
	            System.out.println("Inside Inner Class");
	        }
	    }
	}
