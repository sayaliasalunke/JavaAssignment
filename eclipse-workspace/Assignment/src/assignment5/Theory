	- A copy constructor is a constructor that creates a new object by copying the data of another object.

2️ Use of this keyword
ANS:

	- The this keyword refers to the current object of the class.
	- It is used to differentiate between instance variables and local variables.
	- It is also used to call the current class constructor.

3️ Use of super keyword
ANS :
	- The super keyword refers to the parent class object.
	- It is used to access parent class variables and methods.
	- It is also used to call the parent class constructor.

4️ What is static keyword used for?
ANS :
	- The static keyword is used for class-level variables and methods.
	- A static variable is shared among all objects of the class.
	- A static method can be called without creating an object of the class.

5️ What are static blocks and static methods?
ANS :
	- A static block is a block that runs only once when the class is loaded and it is used to initialize static variables.
	- A static method is a method that belongs to the class and can be called using the class name without creating an object.
